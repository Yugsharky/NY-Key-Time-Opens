# NY-Key-Time-Opens
NY Time Key Levels plots horizontal lines at the New York midnight, London open (10:00 NY), and New York close (18:00 NY) opening prices. These levels highlight institutional session starts, acting as potential support and resistance for intraday trading. Customizable colors, styles, and visibility.

Why do these levels act as support and resistance? 
- Institutional Activity: These times mark major session transitions when large institutions, banks, and market makers enter the market, often leading to increased volatility and significant price movements.
- Order Flow: Many pending orders and stop-loss placements are triggered around these session opens/closes, making these prices psychologically significant.
- Market Memory: Traders and algorithms often reference these levels historically for entries, exits, and risk management, reinforcing their role as support or resistance.
Liquidity Zones: Opening prices often represent areas of high liquidity, meaning price may revisit or react to these levels.
